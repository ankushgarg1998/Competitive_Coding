Hi.
Welcome.
I'm Ankush.
(Yes! these are my slides.)
















DISCLAIMER

- Shit might get a little cray.
So, doubts between topics are not just allowed but encouraged.

If you ask a stupid question, you're stupid for a day.
If you don't, you're remain stupid for your life.

- We're going to be coding live.
Feel free to code with me
or take pictures of the code/board, if you want to
or ask for it later from IEEE MSIT CS.

- I'm no Expert, let's learn together.












Before we start, I'll explain what we're about to discuss today.
For that. Why don't you tell me about your expectations from today's session?


















BINARY SEARCH.

    - The algo (Divide & Conquer).
    - Quick Code.

    - The beauty
        10 -> 4
        20 -> 5
        100-> 7
        1 million trillion
        1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -> ?


    An easy question.

    The Valentine's day Question
    ASHIGIFT - https://www.codechef.com/problems/ASHIGIFT

            Please give it a read.
            - Your Approaches?

            Solving just the first subproblem.
            Time Complexity.

            - Algorithmically solving the full problem
            - Let's Code it off.








Either two crazy-ass question on Binary Search or move on to Greedy Algos.

    A simpler yet more difficult question.
    DIVSET - https://www.codechef.com/problems/DIVSET

            Please give it a read.
            - Your Approaches?
            Solve both subtasks at once, 
            Remember to take care of Time Complexity

            - Algorithmically solving the full problem
            - Let's Code it off.


    SCHEDULE - https://www.codechef.com/problems/SCHEDULE


















GREEDY ALGORITHMS.
    
    The most generic example.
    Make a sum of 45 in minimun number of notes.
    5, 10, 20.
    2, 13, 20.

    
    
    The two properties that tell you that a problem is greedy.
    Greedy Choice property.
    Optimal Substructure.

    
    
    A simple greedy problem

    THREE STANDARD PROBLEMS
        Activity Selection Problem
            - The problem
            Activity    A1      A2      A3      A4      A5      A6
            Start       0       3       1       5       5       8
            Finish      6       4       2       9       7       9
            - Algo
                - Why Greedy? Why it works?
            - The code.
        
        Fractional Knapsack
            - The Problem
            Capacity 50kg
            Item        A       B       C
            Weight      10      20      30
            Value       60      100     120
            - The Algo
        
        Job Sequencing Problem
            - The Problem
            Job         A   B   C   D   E
            Deadline    2   1   2   1   3
            Priority    60  19  27  25  15
            *Each job takes one unit time.
            - The Algo

    
    
    A Codechef Question. 
    A brilliant example of how a simple question can play with your mind.
